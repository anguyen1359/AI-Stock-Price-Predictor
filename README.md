# Stock-Predictors-Traders

I've developed a LSTM model that analyzes historical data of any particular stock and provides a prediction of the next price value.

Model:
- Stock_Predictor_JPN.ipynb: Juypter Notebook containing the main code for creating, training, and evaluating the model
- Stock_Predictor_Func.py: Python File that contains all the functions that is used within the Juypter Notebook

- Stock_Predictor_Performance: Image of Confusion Matrix of up and down trends compared of model and actual values




# Additional Information
Note that this model shouldn't be used to make financial based decision and is not recommended to use real stock decisions
