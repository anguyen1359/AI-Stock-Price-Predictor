# Stock-Predictors-Traders

I've developed a LSTM model that analyzes historical data of any particular stock and provides a prediction of the next price value.

Folders:

Model:
- Stock_Predictor_JPN.ipynb: Juypter Notebook containing the main code for creating, training, and evaluating the model
- Stock_Predictor_Func.py: Python File that contains all the functions that is used within the Juypter Notebook

Images/Animations:
- LSTM_Learning_1000.gif: Animation of the LSTM model learning over time (1000 epochs)
- LSTM_SPY_Optimized.png: Image containing Model predictions during evaluation of SPY with optimized paramaters
- Stock_Predictor_Performance: Image of Confusion Matrix of up and down trends compared of model and actual values
